# brute-force
http://chocolate.cyber.org.il
In this project, I investigated the weaknesses of a chocolate site.
The main goal was to find out if it was possible to discover user passwords using Brute Force.
We knew the length of a possible password, so when entering a username I did brute force in python to check all possible passwords.
